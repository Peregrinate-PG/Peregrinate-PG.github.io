      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

      Learned:
      - Synthesize your own blockchain solutions
      - Gain an in-depth understanding of the specific mechanics of Bitcoin
      - Understand Bitcoinâ€™s real-life applications and learn how to attack and destroy Bitcoin, Ethereum, smart contracts and Dapps, and alternatives to Bitcoinâ€™s Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

As an undergraduate student at the Yingcai Honors College of UESTC (top 2% selective program), I pursue rigorous interdisciplinary research spanning game theory and artificial intelligence. My first-authored works on Q-learning in evolutionary games are currently under review at IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics (IF=11.8) and an Applied Mathematical Modelling "special issue", developing novel Q-learning frameworks for cooperation dynamics. Beyond my core focus on estimation theory, I actively bridge mathematical foundations with practical AI implementations â€“ from ROF-based image denoising to neural PDE solvers â€“ evidenced by my APMCM Outstanding Winner Award. Maintaining a 3.99/4.00 GPA while conducting these explorations, I further strengthen technical communication through IELTS 7.0-certified English proficiency. I am particularly driven to investigate how adaptive learning mechanisms can reshape strategic decision-making in complex systems.
