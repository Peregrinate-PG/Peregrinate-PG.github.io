      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me
I am **Xiang Li (ÊùéÊÉ≥)**, you can also call me **Alex Sterling**. I am currently an undergraduate student at **[Yingcai Honors College of UESTC](https://www.yingcai.uestc.edu.cn/en/)** majoring in Computer Science and Technology.

My research interests primarily focus on **network science** and **evolutionary game theory**. My initial researches explore **Q-learning** mechanisms in strategic decision-making, with two first-authored papers under review at *IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics* and *"special issue"* column under *Applied Mathematical Modelling*. 

Alongside my recent work on pair estimation theory, I enjoy bridging mathematical models with computational implementations. This includes deriving ROF algorithms for image denoising, designing neural networks for solving PDEs, and experimenting with pansharpening techniques. Moreover, I am also very interested in mathematical modeling. Our underwater image restoration scheme won the **first prize** in 2024 Asia and Pacific Mathematical Contest in Modeling(APMCM).

With a **3.99/4.00 GPA** and **IELTS 7.0** certification, I am confident that I have the necessary knowledge reserve and language ability for scientific research. I strive to maintain both academic rigor and effective cross-cultural communication. I'm always open to discussing game-theoretic learning frameworks, AI-driven mathematical modeling, or any interdisciplinary challenges.

If our research interests resonate, welcome collaborative opportunities ‚Äì let's connect!üòÄ
